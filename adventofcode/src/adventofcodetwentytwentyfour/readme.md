    > to get the partOne answer len/2 needs to be swapped with len in all occurrences and to swap the commented line from 7 to 8<br>I'm sure theres a better way to do this but I cant think of one, normally a better method is obvious once I get the first version working

    > part 2 will probably only work for my input as it was made by analyzing my program input by hand to find a pattern and then making a (slightly brute force) search using that pattern

    > not really much point posting the code for this one, the entire puzzle is just implement standard BFS.
